# Remote Engineering Radar

Public, automated radar for remote software engineering jobs outside LinkedIn.
Focused on Junior, Mid-level, and Senior Java roles, backend or fullstack, plus
Senior Frontend, Fullstack, React, and React Native roles, in Brazil, LATAM, and
the Americas.

## Stack

Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL (Supabase).
GitHub Actions ingests, normalizes, deduplicates, and scores jobs; Vercel serves the
public report.

## Getting Started

Requires **Node.js 24.21+ (24.x)**, **pnpm 11.22.0**, and **Docker**.

With Docker running:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the local database, applies migrations, and serves the app at
http://localhost:3000. The example environment file includes the local database URLs.

To populate the database:

```bash
pnpm ingest
```

Only remote jobs are saved. Optional settings in [`.env.example`](.env.example) let
you add Greenhouse, Ashby, and Lever boards and raise FrontendBR's GitHub API rate
limit with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
